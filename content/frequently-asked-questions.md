### What if I'm allergic to or just don't like either chocolate, cannabis, or coffee?

Vibe will offer a "2/3" option soon, so you can remove any one item from your provision.

### What if I prefer Tea to Coffee?

We love Tea too, and will be offering a Tea option very soon.  

### What if like coffee but only drink decaf?

Decaf is awesome! You can specify your preference for decaffeinated coffee beans when you subscribe.  

### Do I have to get a delivery every month?

There will be a few frequency options, including the standard monthly delivery, a Double Shot option (2 provisions per month), Slow Motion (1x provision every 2 months / 2 deliveries per quarter).  

### Can I pause my subscription if I'm traveling or want to take a break?

Of course, just contact us **service@vibeltd.co** in advance and we'll make it happen.  

### Is Cannabis legal?

Yessir! In 1996 California voters passed Prop 215 legalizing medical marijuana, and then in 2016 California voters (finally) passed Prop 64 legalizing recreational use of marijuana for adults.  

### Is the coffee and chocolate infused with cannabis?

Nope. The coffee and chocolate offerings are all natural, sourced from the best roasters and chocolate makers. We keep it simple.  

**Edibles are awesome, we will occasionally include tasty cannabis infused treats.  

### This the greatest idea since The Facebook, is Vibe hiring and/or can I invest in the company?
